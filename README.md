This is a Chat App created using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO.

It is hosted on Heroku on https://chatapp-atjain02.herokuapp.com/

You can go to the link and test the app. Testing can be better done if you have multiple instances of the webapp open, so that a proper chat between users can be demonstrated. 

Local testing can also be done by cloning the repository, running "npm install", then running "node index.js", and then navgiating to "localhost:3000"
